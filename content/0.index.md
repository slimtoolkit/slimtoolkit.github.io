#title
Inspect, Optimize and Debug Your Containers

#description
You don't have to change anything in your application images to make them smaller! Keep doing what you are doing. Use the base image you want. Use the package manager you want. Don't worry about hand optimizing your Dockerfile. Don't worry about manually creating Seccomp and AppArmor security profiles.

#extra
  ::list
  - Use the **build** command to minify your container image and to generate security profiles
  - Use the [**xray**] command to understand your container images before and after you optimize
  - Use the [**debug**] command to debug your slim container images
  - Lots of [**examples**](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples)!
  - Try [**Slim.AI SaaS**](https://portal.slim.dev/login?invitecode=invite.1s85zlfnYX0p5TT1XKja49pAHbL) where you can get even more powerful insights including how your container image changed.
