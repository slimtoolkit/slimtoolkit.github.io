#title
Inspect, Minify and Debug Your Containers

#description
You don't have to change anything in your application images to make them smaller! Keep doing what you are doing and generate containers that are **30 times smaller***. Use the base image you want. Use the package manager you want. Don't worry about hand optimizing your Dockerfile. Don't worry about manually creating Seccomp and AppArmor security profiles.

#extra
  ::list
  - Use the **build** command to minify your container image and to generate security profiles.
  - Use the [**xray**] command to understand your container images before and after you optimize.
  - Use the [**debug**] command to debug your slim container images.
  - Lots of [**examples**](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples)! See how different container images get **10 to 30 times smaller***.

## Interactive Command Example

Don't worry about remembering all `slim` command line flags. Use the interactive mode to select the command flags and values.
